Iterate over the numbers from 0 to 999999.

1. List the ones without repeating digits. (there are 168571)
2. Count above, no printing.
3. Use "time" to calculate runtime.

Note: Iterating in order, there are ways to skip numbers without testing them.
      That's not necessarily the point of this exercise.
