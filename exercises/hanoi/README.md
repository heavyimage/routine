Given a number of disk, print the steps to move the [tower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_hanoi) from peg to peg.

1. Print solution using format: 2 -> 3. One step per line.
2. Count above, no printing.
3. Use "time" to calculate runtime.

Notes:
- The solution for n rings takes 2^n - 1 steps.
- Take number of disks from command-line, default to 3.
