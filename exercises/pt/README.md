Print tasks for the day.

This is a spin on a script that I run every morning to append to my TODO list.
Some tasks happen every day, others on week days or the week-end. The order is
important.

concepts:
- getting today's date
- printing a date in a specific format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- determining the day of the week (Monday, ...)
- determining "membership" to Monday..Friday
- accumulating strings in a list
- iterating over a list
- function overloading and/or default arguments -- today vs arbitrary date
