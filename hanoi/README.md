Given a number of disk, print the steps to move the [tower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_hanoi) from peg to peg.

The solution for n disks takes 2^n - 1 steps. I use this, unfairly or not, to benchmark implementations
in different languages. It starts taking "real" time around 23 disks.

concepts:
- parsing the command-line
- string -> int
- basic console printing
- recursion
- function pointers
